# Ray Tracer: A Weekend Path Tracer

This repository contains the implementation of a simple yet powerful path tracer. It’s designed to help you understand the fundamentals of ray tracing while producing stunning images with realistic lighting. The project architecture is extendable, making it a perfect starting point for building a more advanced ray tracer.

## Introduction

This project is based on course notes adapted into a practical "how-to" guide for creating a path tracer. The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of ray tracing principles through hands-on implementation. While the resulting program won’t be a full-featured ray tracer, it includes indirect lighting, a feature that has made ray tracing a staple in movies.

## Features

- **Basic Path Tracing**: Simulates light interactions with objects to produce photorealistic images.
- **PPM Image Output**: Renders images in the plain text PPM format for simplicity.
- **Extendable Architecture**: A solid base to add advanced ray tracing features.
- **C++ Implementation**: Uses clean, simple C++ with modern features for clarity and efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for building the project)
- Familiarity with vector mathematics (e.g., dot product, vector addition)
